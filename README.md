EmployeesQX Test Database

Employees (or EmployeesQX) is a very simple sample test database to be used for relational database systems. In is inspired from similar test databases included in Oracle, MySQL or other database systems over the years.

This patch makes it easy to download ready-to-use database files, when supported. Or SQL scripts, to be run in a database administrator, to create and populate the few tables with data.

The database is also used for automated tests for my Data Xtractor applications, including Model xtractor, Query Xtractor and Visual Xtractor. The apps also include the SQL creation scripts in the setup. Employees ready-to-use database files are used as SQLite and Microsoft SQL CE samples.
